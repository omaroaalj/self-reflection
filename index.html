                Throughout my life, my parents have helped me get to where I am today.
                They always encourage me to do the best work possible.

            <h4>Belonging</h4>
            <p>
                Throughout these last 3 years, I have had a great sense of belonging.
                I can always turn to my family and friends.

                If I can focus in on what is causing a problem, whether it's a bug in some code
                or in real life, I always seek a solution.

                My goal is to become a Software Engineer when I graduate. I have learned and gained
                a lot of experience and am excited to use what I know and learn new things in work.

                There will always be something new that I didn't know before. I value feedback with
                the goal to improve.

            <p>
                What the last 3 years have taught me are to be determined, focused, and grateful. Every
                experience meant something to me, whether its learning, thinking, belonging, or creating.
                Thanks for everything!
